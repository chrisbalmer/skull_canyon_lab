# Skull Canyon Lab

This is a set of scripts that will build out a basic lab on ESXi. It was
developed and tested on an Intel Skull Canyon NUC.

## Requirements

- You'll need your own OVA files to load onto ESXi for templates
- You'll need your own vCenter ISO
- It is expected that you have enough RAM to run your VMs and vCenter
- You'll need ESXi pre-loaded with a management IP, username and password

## TODO

- More documentation
- Deploy vCenter
- Deploy VMs
